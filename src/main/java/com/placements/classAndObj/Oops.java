	 OOPS refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use objects as a primary source to
	 implement what is to happen in the code. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions
	 that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

	* access modifiers: public/private/protected/default
	* public:visible to all classes in app
	* private:only available within the class it has been defined
	* protected:only accessible within package of that application and to its subclass
	* default:accessible within the same class and within its package(its also default tyoe of that variable)
